# Fingerprint-
This is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a company security system using employee fingerprints. The system allows employees to register their fingerprint templates, authenticate themselves, and provides basic employee management features. The project uses Java Swing for the graphical interface and text files for data storage (later versions can integrate databases). It is designed as a learning project for understanding Java GUI programming, file handling, and basic security concepts.
